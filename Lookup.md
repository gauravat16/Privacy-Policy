**ADs**

I have used google admob ads in the application.

**Permissions**

1. receive data from Internet
2. view network connections
3. full network access
    These permissions are needed to fetch definitons from online dicitionary plugins.

4. run at startup
    This is used to run the clippy service in background.
5. draw over other apps
    This is used to show the popup dicitionary. 
6. control vibration
    This is used to use haptic vibration alerts.
7. prevent device from sleeping
    This is used to run few tasks like uploading backup to google drive etc in the background.
